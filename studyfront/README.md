# StudyFindr Frontend

This is the React frontend for the StudyFindr application.

## Development

For setup and development instructions, please refer to the main README.md file in the root directory of this project.

## Available Scripts

This frontend was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

When working directly in this directory, you can use:

- `npm start` - Runs the development server
- `npm test` - Runs tests
- `npm run build` - Creates a production build

However, it's recommended to use the root-level scripts which manage both frontend and backend:

```bash
# From the project root:
npm run start:frontend  # Start just the frontend
npm start               # Start both frontend and backend
```

## Learn More

You can learn more in the [Create React App documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started).
